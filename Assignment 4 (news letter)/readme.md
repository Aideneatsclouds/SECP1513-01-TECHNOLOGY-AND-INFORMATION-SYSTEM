# REFLECTION
This talk motivated me to recognize the power of digital transformation
and the importance of staying adaptable in an ever-evolving world. It
was eye-opening to see how businesses that embraced technology
flourished while others struggled to keep up. I also developed a greater
interest in network infrastructure, realizing how challenges in managing it
lead to innovative solutions. Technologies like RUCKUS, with its streamlined
control and clear monitoring, make networks more efficient and create
valuable opportunities for both businesses and society
