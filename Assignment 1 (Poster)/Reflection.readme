From this industry talk, I learned that EY uses a human-centered approach in technology to solve client challenges and drive innovation. EY provides consulting services across tech areas like digital transformation, data, and cybersecurity, tailored to each client's needs. Their global reach and industry expertise allow them to help businesses grow and adapt effectively. EY's focus on a collaboratice tech approach also gives graduates and interns a chance to gain practical, career-boosting experience.
