# REFLECTION
From this industry talk, I learned that EY uses a human-centered approach to technology to solve client challenges and drive innovation. EY provides consulting services tailored to each client's needs across tech areas like digital transformation, data, and cybersecurity. Their global reach and industry expertise help businesses grow and adapt effectively. EY's focus on a collaborative tech approach also gives graduates and interns a chance to gain practical, career-boosting experience.
